# Capstone Project Proposal

* Fork this repo and update this README file with your proposal.
* Make sure to preview your proposal in a markdown preview and [use valid markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
  * Unformatted/unreadable proposals will be rejected

## Project Description

Allow users to select from a list of famous quotes (may include a daily or weekly featured quote), then interpret them in their own words.  They will then be able to view other's interpretations and leave those users comments or critiques.  They will also be able to nominate user's interpretations for a position as featured quotes (stretch feature).


## What problem does your project solve?

We all need to improve as writers, not in our grammar or mechanics but in our ability to express ourselves concisely and accurately.  The app will give user's the tools to work in these areas, invite discussion and growth through critique and most importantly help to demonstrate that we all interpret 'simple' quotes in different ways.  That things we think we understand fundamentally are actually understood very differently by others

## Who has this problem?

We all write every day, whether via emails, texts, journaling.  Even people who think they work purely in code have to communicate via github commits.  Increasing our ability to convey ourselves clearly and succinctly will make us all better workers.  Thinking critically about how we understand and communicate information will make us all better people.


## How will your project solve this problem?

The goal is to foster a community that is committed to practicing and giving feedback to each other.  By focusing on a small snippet of text (a quote) and inviting feedback, as well as reading other people's interpretations


## What inputs does it need?

create user accounts (user inputs information)
create user interpretations (user inputs their text or interpretations)
create user feedback (user inputs commentary on others' works)


## What outputs does it produce?

A personal collection of quotes to be interpreted
A history of past interpretations
		A repository of commentary linked to that interpretation
A communal repository of all interpretations of a given quote


## What technologies do you plan to use?

React,
MongoDB (strongly considering trying to dive into graphQL after today's presentation)
Typescript
(very open to suggestions of feedback regarding how to pull interesting technologies into this project!)


## Prioritized Feature list (Label stretch features with STRETCH)
